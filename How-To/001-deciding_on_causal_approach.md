Currently my suggestion is to 

 - Write down in bullet point format what you know about the causal mechansim.
 - Write down what data you know exists and what data you think you can get.
 - Create a causal graph in the spirit of do-calculus (although it doesn't need to be a DAG).
 - Review that a couple of times to see what you've forgotten.
 - List possible structural assumptions.
 - Look for randomization options.
 - Repeat iteratively until you've settled on an identification plan.
